# Hopper Filters
Spigot plugin to allow hoppers to filter items given filter names.  
[Hopper Filters | SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hopper-filters.106508/)

## Description from spigotmc.org post
This plugin allows players to set filters on hoppers by naming them in
an anvil, based on the plugin shown in LiveOverflow's recent video. 

If the item's id matches the name of the hopper, the hopper will allow 
it to pass. If it does not match, the hopper will not accept the item. 
Additionally, the filters accept wildcards: * will match 0 or more of 
any character and ? will match exactly one of any character. Unlike in 
LiveOverflow's version, this one accepts wildcards anywhere in the 
filter and not just the beginning and end. Like LiveOverflow's, it 
accepts multiple filters separated by commas and will match any of the 
filters given.
